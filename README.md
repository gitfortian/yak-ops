<h1 align="center">Yak Ops</h1>

<p align="center">
  A focused data operations platform for datasource management, offline synchronization, resources, data quality, and system administration.
</p>

> Yak Ops is continuously evolving to make complex data engineering workflows simpler and more product-oriented.

## Current scope

Yak Ops currently keeps a deliberately small and maintainable feature set:

- datasource management;
- offline synchronization and the realtime CDC control plane under Data Integration;
- resource management, including files, clients, and connectors;
- data-quality rule templates, table monitors, manual checks, and execution results;
- system management and security administration.

Realtime synchronization requires a compatible Yak CDC Runtime implementing the secure deployment
contract in `docs/realtime-sync-runtime-contract.md`.

## Quick start

Install `yak-framework:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` into the same Maven local repository first.

Create the Yak Security database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE yak_security
  DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Build and start:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
java -jar yak-ops-boot/target/yak-ops-boot-1.0.0.jar
```

Verify the application:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/test/ping
```

Swagger UI:

```text
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

### Offline synchronization

Offline synchronization keeps task definition management, Link-Up engine integration, worker registration, execution reconciliation, and scheduling support.

### Data quality

The first data-quality milestone forms a small closed loop:

```text
select a table -> create a monitor -> add rules from templates
-> run manually -> inspect execution results
```

The built-in templates cover table row count, column not-null ratio, column uniqueness, numeric range, enum membership, and custom read-only SQL.

### Datasource plugins

Datasource plugins provide connection normalization, connection tests, and catalog metadata capabilities.

### Resource management

Resource management supports managed files and pluggable Local, MinIO, and HDFS storage backends.

## Removed domains and data

The following runtime modules and frontend pages are not assembled:

- Data Development and its task plugins;
- historical data-quality scheduling and alerting implementations.

Existing database tables are not automatically dropped. Deployments that already contain historical data can retain it for audit or migrate it separately.

## Security note

Datasource connections, offline synchronization, and data-quality checks can access external systems. Production deployments should apply project permissions, network restrictions, audit rules, query limits, and secret management before granting access.
